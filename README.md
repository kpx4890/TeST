# SUBZero (Secure USB Backup Zero) <br /> 
This is the main repository for the SUBZero, a Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless USB NAS.  Credit for the python https server skeleton code goes to [Rich Moulton](https://github.com/rhmoult/SecurityTools/blob/master/Platform_Independent/Python/httpsWithUpload/src/httpsWithUpload.py).

## What You Need
* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Micro SD card (minimum 16GB to use prebuilt image)
* Pi Zero USB Stem (Optional)
* Soldering Station (Optional)
* 3D Printer (Optional)

## How it Works
Just plug in the SUBZero to a USB port and it will broadcast a WiFi network named SUBZero (the default password is raspberry for WiFi, and pi:raspberry for the OS.  PLEASE change this once it's up and running).  Once connected to the network, you can browse to https://192.168.1.1 and start uploading/sharing files. This functions as a standalone network, meaning *no Internet connection required!*.

## Installation

#### Flashing the Raspberry Pi Zero W with the SUBZero Image

The easiest way to get up and running with the SUBZero is by grabbing [SUBZero.tar.bz2](https://github.com/Halcy0nic/SUBZero/releases/tag/1v12) image, untaring it, and flashing it onto an SD card.  I recommend using [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for flashing the SD card.  Etcher is easy to use and works on Windows, OSX, and Linux.

#### Installing from source

First you are going to need to flash Raspbian Stretch Lite/Desktop onto an SD card and placed it inside your Raspberry Pi Zero W. Then boot it up and run the following command

```
sudo raspi-config
```

Here you will be dropped into the Raspberry Pi configuration menu where you will be able to connect to a wireless network, change your raspberry pi login information, set your country code, etc. After you are done save your changes and `reboot`

After you reboot we will go ahead and get the device ready to download and install the SUBZero code. First run `sudo apt-get install git -y` in order to install git on the device.

Afterwards, tgit so install the SUBZero on your Raspberry Pi Zero W, clone the SUBZero repository from my [GitHub](https://github.com/Halcy0nic/SUBZero) and run the install script.

``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/Halcy0nic/SUBZero.git
$ cd ./SUBZero
$ sudo chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```
During the installation, you will be prompted to enter data for the self-signed certificate. You can simply enter a '.' or dummy data for all of the fields when generating the cert.  Once you have installed the SUBZero, reboot the machine and you should see a WiFi Access Point named 'SUBZero' that you can connect to with the password 'raspberry'.  Once connected to the SUBZero wireless network you can browse to https://192.168.1.1 and start uploading files.


<br />NOTE: Your browser might complain about the cert being invalid (because it's self-signed).  Proceed to the webpage anyway and add an exception if necessary.

## PI Zero USB Stem

According to [Zerostem](https://zerostem.io), the Pi 'Zero Stem is a PCB shim that turns a Raspberry Pi Zero into a USB dongle. Once the shim is installed, your Raspberry Pi can be plugged directly into a computer or USB hub without any additional cables or power supplies.'  This is much more convenient than using a USB adapter, which would normally be required for a Pi Zero.  Installing the Zero Stem will require some soldering experience however.  Once you have a Pi and Zero Stem you can turn it into a USB by soldering the STEM onto the Pi Zero using their [instructions](https://zerostem.io/installation/).


## 3D printed case
Lots of thanks go to Nick Engmann for this one.  He developed the [3D printed SUBZero Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3389059).  Nick actively contributes to the SUBZero project and has some amazing projects of his own on his [website](https://nickengmann.com), so go check him out!


## Routing
By default, the SUBZero is not configured to route any traffic or provide internet access.  Configuring the device to route traffic on the network is pretty simple though.  I found a [tutorial](https://frillip.com/using-your-raspberry-pi-3-as-a-wifi-access-point-with-hostapd/) by Phil Martin showing how to do this.  First, log in to the SUBZero using the credentials 'pi:raspberry' (you should change this) and open /etc/sysctl.conf as sudo with vim/vi/nano.  Uncomment the line containing 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' by removing the # from the beginning of the line, save the changes, and return to the terminal.  Assuming you are using wlan0 for your WiFi interface and eth0 for your internet connection, execute the following commands on the terminal:

``` bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE  
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"
```

Lastly open the file /etc/rc.local as sudo and add the following line at the bottom, right above exit 0:

``` bash
iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat 
```

## Expanding the Filesystem
By default, the Raspbian root file system is around 2GB. However, if you have an SD card with more capacity it's a great idea to go ahead and expand your installation to the entire SD card. This way you can have the maximum amount of file storage on your SUBZero device.

To expand to the filesystem boot up the SUBZero device and open up a terminal and execute the following command

``` bash
sudo raspi-config
```

You will be presented with a GUI menu, go ahead and go down to "Advanced Options" and hit enter.
[![Advanced Options](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/images/raspi-config.png)]

Then at the second menu hit enter on "Expand Filesystem". You will them be prompted to restart your machine after the operation is over. Then your done with the software side of things.
